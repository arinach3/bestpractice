# About the project
The app was created for recipes, a place to view fun recipes, mark your favorites and add your own (TBD).

# Built with
React

# Third party libraries
react-router-dom

# Usage
In the app the user can view different recipes, mark his favorites and view them in a favorites page.
The app works with a router so each page and recipe have their own URL.
The recipes can be added easily via the Recipes.js and are automatically added to the sidebar and the router.
Future development will give the user the ability to add his own recipes as well as those provided by the app.
